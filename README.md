**About Project ( Overview ):**
This project provisions a complete ECS (Elastic Container Service) setup on AWS Fargate using Terraform. It automates the deployment of a containerized application by creating:

An ECS cluster
A task definition (with Docker image)
A Fargate service
Associated network configurations (subnets, security groups)
IAM roles and other dependencies via input variables

**Benifit to configure ecs using terraform**:
Using ECS with Terraform brings the power of containerization and the discipline of Infrastructure as Code together. It enables fast, scalable, secure, and repeatable cloud-native deployments.
